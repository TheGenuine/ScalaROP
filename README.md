This is my attempt at a Scala port of the small DSL for "Railway Oriented Programming" (ROP)
proposed by @ScottWlaschin in his blog post ["A recipe for a functional app"]
(http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/series/a-recipe-for-a-functional-app.html)

Disclaimer: I did this as a learning exercise to learn a bit of Scala, functional programming,
Scala Test and ROP. It's an experiment and should be treated as such. That said, I'm more than 
happy to accept comments on how the implementation might be improved.

In my [TantrixSevenTilesPuzzleResolver](https://github.com/jorander/TantrixSevenTilesPuzzleResolver) I've used
my implementation in the SevenTilesPuzzleResolver class.
